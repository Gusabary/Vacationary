# 2019 Summer Vacation

In the repository is my learning stuff during 2019 summer vacation.

Listed below are some websites where I really got help:

### [OpenGL](<https://learnopengl-cn.github.io/>)

You can learn about OpenGL here. This can be useful when learning CG.

[Here](<https://learnopengl.com/>) is English website.

### [Python](<https://github.com/jackfrued/Python-100-Days>)

I learned about Python from this repo, but just a little bit.

### [Machine Learning](<https://datawhalechina.github.io/leeml-notes/#/>)

I learned about Machine Learning kind of more than Python, from this fantastic notes.

### [Flutter](<https://flutter.axuer.com/docs/>)

I just learned about Flutter for one day, but it looks like better than React Native.

[Here](<https://flutter.dev/>) is English website.
