# Code

In the directory are some React codes for exercise.

### tic-tac-toe.js

It is the code in the React [tutorial](https://react.docschina.org/tutorial/tutorial.html), and I just did a simple collection.

### todo-list

It is a literal todo-list with function of a simple significance setter and filter.

### themometer

The original of the code is in the React [docs](https://react.docschina.org/docs/lifting-state-up.html).

The core of the task is to make the themometer show temperature in both Celsius and Fahrenheit at the same time.

### Ifohem

*Ifohem* means *Interface of Hermes*. *Hermes* is the name of [this project](https://github.com/linxuyalun/BPM-lab). And the task of *Ifohem* is to render the mainview of it.

*Ifohem* is used to test acquisition of Material-UI.
