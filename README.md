# Winter Vacation

In the repository is my learning stuff during 2019 winter vacation.

Listed below are some websites where I really got help:

+ [**MDN**](https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-CN/) 

  You can learn about HTML, CSS and JavaScript here. 

  If you get confused with some expressions, replace `zh-CN` with `en-US` in the URL to change language and you may understand them.

+ [**ES6**](https://www.jianshu.com/p/287e0bb867ae) 

  You can learn about ES6 here.
